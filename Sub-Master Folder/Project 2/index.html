      <p> Welcome to my webpage! This website honestly doesn't really have a purpose and contains random things. </p>
      <p> Well, now that I think of it, Josh "made" a chat site but really embeded someone else's work using iframe, so please<!-- Link to instant mail composition --> <a class="shame" title="Yeah! Go get 'em!" href="" onclick="window.open('mailto:jhickson.ep@mysummitps.org?subject=Shame on you!&body=Why did you embed that?!')"> shame</a> him for me. </p>
      <p> This page was created for a project we are doing in class where we simply just make about anything from scratch (with js). At the time, I couldn't think of anything, so I decided to make something simple. Due to that, I have made multiple, random things. </p>
      <p> Unfortunately, me not being a very creative person, it has been hard to think of ideas to put up, or at least not very pathetic ideas. </p>
      <p> While the project was supposed to involve js, I've not added js to certain things simply because it was not needed. </p>
      <p> Like mentioned in the content below, I am so happy that I finally managed to get the navbar to actually follow with scrolling. </p>
      <p> What I find frustrating about making this is that I just can't seem to come up with ideas and it takes long amounts of time to actually get something done. Since I haven't really thought of any new functions to add, I have just resorted to somewhat decorating my site </p>
      <p> If I actually have the memory to do so, I might continue to update this page since I found it quite fun to decorate this page </p>
      <strong> Content that is on the site: </strong>
      <!-- A simple list containing all of the content I have added -->
      <ul id="content">
        <br>
        <li> A random number generator that can have a range set (I don't know if I can get this fixed :( ) </li>
        <br>
        <li> A navbar that actually follows as the page is scrolled (which I failed at doing the first time we made html pages) </li>
        <br>
        <li> A search bar that does an inurl search, which means it only looks for words within urls, not including the content of the page itself </li>
        <br>
        <li> A link to give me feedback </li>
        <br>
        <li> A link to shame Josh for iframing someone else's work </li>
        <br>
        <li> A miniature easter egg that I might update over time <!-- I lied --> </li>
        <br>
        <li> Anchors for the top and bottom of the page </li>
        <br>
        <li> An anchor for my steam profile, along with my profile picture, decorated with a border, and an overlaying steam logo </li>
        <br>
        <li> Magical, hidden comments within the code </li>
      </ul>
