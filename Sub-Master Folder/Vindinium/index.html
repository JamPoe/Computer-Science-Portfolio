            <p> For our final project, we worked on bots for a website called Vindinium.</p>
            <p> In Vindinium, you get a basic template for making a bot, in which you fight and compete against other coded bots online.</p>
            <p> What was interesting about this project is that instead of starting from scratch, we worked off of something that was giving to us and we tried to understand what we were given.</p>
