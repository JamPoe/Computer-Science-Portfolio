    <h1> So, things about me: </h1>
    <center> <p> <strong> School: </strong> I am in 9th grade and go to Everest High School. </p> </center>
      <center> <p> <strong> Hobbies: </strong> For hobbies, I really like using technology, from playing video games to coding. I got into technology because I grew up with them. For the majority of my life, I have used computers. In addition I also like cats </p> </center>
    <center> <p> <strong> Programming: </strong> I, before, have not really used html much. I learned about html a few years back, only learning the basics so I thought that learning it now would be easy. Learning html was somewhat easy, but there were many new things and suprises that I had never known about before. </p> </center>
    <center> <p> <strong> Video Games: </strong> Since video games have always been an enjoyable portion of my life, here are some games I really like... </p> </center>
    <br>
    <center> <h1> Don't Starve </h1> </center>
    <center> <img width="360" height="240" src="http://img3.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20140523103513/dont-starve-game/images/8/87/Treeguard_Shadow_Promo.jpeg"> </center>
    <br>
    <p> Don't Starve is a dark themed survival game based around a character named Wilson P. Higgsbury. In the trailer for Don't Starve, Wilson is told by an ominous voice within his radio to build a machine. After doing so and throwing the switch, he is thrown into the wilderness, trying to survive and find an escape. </p>
    <p> Don't Starve, unlike similar games like Minecraft or Terraria, has a permadeath system. This means that when you die, everything goes. Don't starve also packs more of a challenge as a replacement for creativity levels. I personally find Don't Starve to be better than Minecraft or other games alike since I do like a bit of a challenge. </p>

    <center> <h1> DayZ (Standalone) </h1> </center>
    <center> <img width="360" height="240" src="http://static.tumblr.com/dpncaxl/CFnm8c0d8/dayz.jpg"> </center>
    <br>
    <p> DayZ is a realistic zombie surival game. In DayZ, you are spawned in a random area on a fictional Russian island called Chernaurus. The game has no official storyline, instead, the character develops their own story through their experiences. The game carries many threats when you just start the game, from zombies, to other people, to harsh seasons and weather. </p>
    <p> I find DayZ to be very enjoyable because of its realism. Zombies are realistic and do not require a shot to the head like your Hollywood zombie, they can be as easily killed as any other player. DayZ's combination of no storyline and permadeath make a good result of players cherishing every single life they go through as a different story. Due to the value of a character and the amount of time contributed into them, combat can be very stressful, like in real life. </p>

    <center> <h1> Garry's Mod (Gmod) </h1> </center>

    <br>
    <p> Garry's Mod is a sandbox game that was made in 2005 as a mod for the game Half Life 2. Garry's Mod does not have any storyline or objective. The game mainly revolves around its community and multiplayer. </p>
    <p> Garry's Mod has a wide variety of player made mods and gamemodes and should be played. The game carries a lot of creativity with the capabilities it gives you. </p>
    <p> Within Garry's mod, since it is sandbox, you can do just about anything. You can build structures or even make stop-motion movies with ragdolls.</p>
      <p> I have really enjoyed this class so far and can't wait to discover more about programming languages :) </p>
